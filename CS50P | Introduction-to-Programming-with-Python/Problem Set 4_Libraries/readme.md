## Problem Set 3 

| Objective | Topic            | Name                       |
| :--- | :--------------- | :------------------------- |
| Emojize   | In a file called emojize.py, implement a program that prompts the user for a str in English and then outputs the ‚Äúemojized‚Äù version of that str, converting any codes (or aliases) therein to their corresponding emoji.|[emojize.py ](https://www.online-python.com/x0gkAI26lb)|
| Frank, Ian and Glen‚Äôs Letters | In a file called figlet.py, implement a program that:Expects zero or two command-line arguments:Zero if the user would like to output text in a random font.Two if the user would like to output text in a specific font, in which case the first of the two should be -f or --font, and the second of the two should be the name of the font.Prompts the user for a str of text.Outputs that text in the desired font.| [figlet.py ](https://www.online-python.com/Olb16J9FRa)             |
| Adieu, Adieu  |In a file called adieu.py, implement a program that prompts the user for names, one per line, until the user inputs control-d. Assume that the user will input at least one name. Then bid adieu to those names, separating two names with one and, three names with two commas and one and, and names with commas and one and, as in the below:| [adieu.py](https://www.online-python.com/ez5J26dPOy) |
| Guessing Game | In a file called game.py, implement a program that:Prompts the user for a level, if the user does not input a positive integer, the program should prompt again.Randomly generates an integer between 1 and, inclusive, using the random module.Prompts the user to guess that integer. If the guess is not a positive integer, the program should prompt the user again.  | [game.py ](https://www.online-python.com/RjPlUQcxpf)          |
| Little Professor | In a file called einstein.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for mass as an integer (in kilograms) and then outputs the equivalent number of Joules as an integer. Assume that the user will input an integer.     | [einstein.py ](https://www.online-python.com/Lba46R8Vzr)          |
| Bitcoin Price Index | In a file called einstein.py, implement a program in Python that prompts the user for mass as an integer (in kilograms) and then outputs the equivalent number of Joules as an integer. Assume that the user will input an integer.     | [einstein.py ](https://www.online-python.com/Lba46R8Vzr)          |
