## Problem Set 7 

| Objective | Topic            | Name                       |
| :--- | :--------------- | :------------------------- |
| NUMB3RS   | In a file called numb3rs.py, implement a function called validate that expects an IPv4 address as input as a str and then returns True or False, respectively, if that input is a valid IPv4 address or not.|[numb3rs.py ](https://www.online-python.com/Pw4s5kL3qn)|
| Watch on YouTube | In a file called watch.py, implement a function called parse that expects a str of HTML as input, extracts any YouTube URL that‚Äôs the value of a src attribute of an iframe element therein, and returns its shorter, shareable youtu.be equivalent as a str. Expect that any such URL will be in one of the formats below. Assume that the value of src will be surrounded by double quotes. And assume that the input will contain no more than one such URL. If the input does not contain any such URL at all, return None| [watch.py ](https://www.online-python.com/ID72zSqAac)             |
| Working 9 to 5  | In a file called working.py, implement a function called convert that expects a str in either of the 12-hour formats below and returns the corresponding str in 24-hour format (i.e., 9:00 to 17:00). Expect that AM and PM will be capitalized (with no periods therein) and that there will be a space before each. Assume that these times are representative of actual times, not necessarily 9:00 AM and 5:00 PM specifically.| [working.py](https://www.online-python.com/43Y5M0KqDv) |
| Regular, um, Expressions   | In a file called um.py, implement a function called count that expects a line of text as input as a str and returns, as an int, the number of times that ‚Äúum‚Äù appears in that text, case-insensitively, as a word unto itself, not as a substring of some other word. For instance, given text like hello, um, world, the function should return 1. Given text like yummy, though, the function should return 0. | [um.py ](https://www.online-python.com/Q0CzvVWp1M)          |
| Response Validation| In a file called response.py, using either validator-collection or validators from PyPI, implement a program that prompts the user for an email address via input and then prints Valid or Invalid, respectively, if the input is a syntatically valid email address. You may not use re. And do not validate whether the email address‚Äôs domain name actually exists.| [response.py](https://www.online-python.com/trkcN3uQBd)             |


 
>[!NOTE]
>Some projects need to install Python packages to run.

>[!IMPORTANT]
>In order to install required packages `you` need to `run` the program `locally` in your computer.
